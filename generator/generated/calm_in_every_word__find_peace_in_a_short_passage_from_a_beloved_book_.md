"Be still, and know that I am God." - Psalm 46:10

This passage from the Bible reminds us to find peace in stillness and to trust in a higher power. It encourages us to let go of our worries and fears and to have faith that everything will work out in the end. Take a moment to breathe deeply and repeat this phrase to yourself, allowing yourself to feel calm and centered.
