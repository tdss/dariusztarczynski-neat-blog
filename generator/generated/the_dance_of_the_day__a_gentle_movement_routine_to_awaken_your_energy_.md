This gentle movement routine is designed to awaken your energy and get your body moving in a gentle and flowing way. It can be done in the morning to start your day off on the right foot, or anytime you need a quick pick-me-up.

1. Begin by standing with your feet hip-width apart and your arms at your sides. Take a deep breath in and raise your arms up overhead, reaching towards the sky.

2. Exhale and slowly lower your arms back down to your sides.

3. Inhale and lift your right arm up overhead, reaching towards the sky. As you exhale, bend your torso to the left, stretching your right side.

4. Inhale and come back to center, then exhale and repeat on the other side.

5. Continue this side-to-side movement, inhaling as you lift your arm up and exhaling as you bend to the side.

6. After a few repetitions, add a gentle sway to your movement, allowing your hips to move side-to-side as you bend.

7. Next, bring your hands to your heart center and begin to sway your hips in a circular motion, moving clockwise.

8. After a few rotations, switch to counterclockwise.

9. From here, begin to move your entire body in a flowing, dance-like motion. Allow your arms to move freely and your hips to sway as you move around the space.

10. Take a few moments to dance freely, letting your body move in whatever way feels good.

11. When you're ready, come back to standing and take a few deep breaths, feeling the energy and vitality that you've awakened in your body.

This gentle movement routine is a great way to start your day or to take a quick break and re-energize your body and mind. Give it a try and see how it makes you feel!
