Games made amazing progress in helping us to understand the motives behind our actions. They found a way into our reward center and learned how to help you build habits.

You win by having unique immersive experiences and generally better life quality.
You lose by addiction to scrolling media portals on your phone.

I have over 15 years of experience in the IT industry, managing many projects and teams. Over the years, I've come to realize that true entertainment doesn't come from technology itself, but from the software layer. And that's where gamification comes from.

It all started when I realized that I needed to share my experiences with others ….. and actually,.. use the occasion to make my knowledge more systematic, to have more scientific background where possible. That's when I decided to write this book.

Gamification requires experience…., And it can be challenging to get started if you're not sure where to begin. That's why I wrote this book. It summarizes the past four years of my experiments with gamification and the valuable experience I've gained along the way.

The book covers all the basics of gamification, including where it comes from and the most popular frameworks used. But, it doesn't stop there. I delve deeper into the behavioral psychology behind gamification and how it reflects human nature.
I explore how it impacts the way we design games and provide insights into the different motivators that drive behavior.

"What drives you?" We will seek answer to this one and similar questions.
Understanding these principles is in fact essential for creating effective gamification strategies, and this section provides a deep dive into this topic.

To make it more engaging, I've added case studies gathered from my own experience, explaining the interesting effects of gamification.
For example, what happened when one super-player dominated the whole leaderboard? Or, how did actually, gamification help me write this book? And that's not all.

The final section of the book gets more practical……, as I describe the tools that I use to design gamification experiences. I also provide real in-play tips for gamification based on the Ogamify software. This section is ideal for anyone who wants to put their newfound knowledge of gamification into practice and start designing their own gamification experiences.

In conclusion, this book, is a practical, real-life guide to gamification that provides readers with the knowledge and tools they need to design their own gamification experiences.
Whether you're looking to create a gamified app, improve your personal habits, or motivate employees in the workplace, this book has something for everyone. So, don't hesitate to get your copy today and start designing your own gamification experience. Thank you for watching!"
