### 1. Prize distribution

**Split the winnings:** Player who wins the prize has the ability to pick one or more other players (or groups) who are also getting some or all of the reward

**Problem:** players without the chance to win are still demotivated

**Requirement:**

either) limit access to superplayers \[JK rate limiting is a different problem to be solved so this solution needs to go somewhere else, and btw it is not a problem right now, we have bigger problems we should focus on namely incentivising supervisors to give more awards. Fixing that problem may well reveal new problems like this, but let’s get to this problem]

or) limit access in other ways to promote slower users (for example, each player can get only one award for himself, so once he gets there and still wins, he needs to pick someone else (without reward) who will receive it) \[see above, different problem, different solution]



### 2. Prize pool

**Pool the winnings:** Players work together against a common challenge, they share the winnings by creating a group (like Whatsapp group creation) and assigning winnings to that group (see above).

**Requirement: **reward is consumed together and has non-monetary value for each of players (having lunch together, supporting a charity, for example supporting the family of an injured worker)



### 3. Relay race

Only a fraction of players can play-for-reward every day.

**Problems**: forces disengagement for the majority of players each day



### 4. 1v2 game - very effective

Each player has a counterpart. The one who wins during some period, gets extra reward.

**Problems**: Some wins will be very easy, some very difficult.

**Requirement**: The system needs to create “pairs” based on performance so far (1st vs 2nd, 3rd vs 4th) so that the bottom half of the leaderboard would have a relatively easy task to accomplish. System actually requires even number of players.



### 5. Scarcity of resources - very effective

There are only a few awards available within a timeframe.

Instead of “57 awards left” the game master gets, 2 normal awards a day, and 1 super award a week. And knows that if he does not spend, they disappear.

### Award grading - very effective

Like above, having  normal awards, super awards and say.. “Hero awards” that are very rare and pay out bonus immediately, might trigger a special mindset between players, where they actually actively look for “things to do/to improve”



### Mystery box

The Player does not know what reward he will get exactly, but knows what is on the table (say $10, $20, $50)

**Problems:** it is hard to explain random generation to someone who accuses the system of cheating.
