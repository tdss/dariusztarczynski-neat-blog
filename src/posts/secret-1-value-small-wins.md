## Key demotivator: expectations vs reality

Everyday we are exposed to great things. Modern media and social media filter out what is bad and ugly and show what is viral, fun and interesting.

You try to find yourself in this world, and achieve something worth being noticed too.

So you start, but the results are far different than from these you saw on social media.

This can be difficult.

This is why the first and most important secret of your personal growth journey is to notice, and value those small improvements that make you 1% better today.
