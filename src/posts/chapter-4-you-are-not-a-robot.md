## Toxic culture of "success mindset"





## And some poison of becoming "the best" at something

There is a common saying that you need to spend 10 000 hours on mastering a skill, to become a world-class performer. It is true. But this is not the whole truth. And how would you call someone telling you just the part of the truth?



There was a car accident yesterday and the driver got admitted to hospital with minor injuries. Would it matter, if the newspaper would omit the fact that he was driving after a few shots?

A true statement without enough context could become "falsy". Our 10,000 hours story is a "falsy" one too. So what are the missing important facts?

What is often overlooked, is that you will hate any practice after 100 hours - if you just keep pushing. Our brain is not capable of doing a monotone task that requires effort to do right.

Your brain would quickly learn how to optimize the effort required and you will NEVER progress.



## What your brain actually needs to learn and master a new skill?





## What do successful people actually do?

They excel in certain areas. That is true! And this is the only thing you see. But they are generalist too.

Did you know that almost all professional sport performers, practice other sports too? It may seem unproductive. They should focus on one sport only. On one muscle memory. Yet the best performers, seem to actually be very good at other sports too! 

And they "waste" their time on other sports, instead of just training the one they are best at!
