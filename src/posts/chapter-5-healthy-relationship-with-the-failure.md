## Is failure ok?



Julia Landauer, one of the most successful professional racer woman, recorded a podcast about rejection lately [[LINK](https://citycurrent.com/2023/06/08/racecar-driver-and-speaker-julia-landauer/)]. 

In sports, you need sponsors, it just costs too much money to continue without them. The struggle is hard as many drivers need to train their skills to the very best and be salesmen at the same time.

To get resources to continue her passion, Julia was sending out about 20-40 carefully selected emails with sponsorship opportunities, getting quite impressive 3-5 responses, out of them 80-90% were a straight "NO". 10-20% were inviting, and out of them only a small fraction actually converted. Each shot was 1/1000 ods shot.

How did she continue and persisted against such low chances of success?

Here most favorite quote (and mine top-10 too!) was Winston's Churchill one:

> Success is stumbling from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm



For Sir Winston, failure was part of success. For Julia, it became one too. 



I know... easy to say. Let's move on then!



## You learn to accept failure (if you manage to push through it many times)



## But we get stuck in failure most of the time



## "I accept that nothing I will do today will bring any significant effect on my life"



## "I expect to fail with the worst-case scenario"
