**About Dariusz Tarczyński**

From software engineering, towards own company and multiple startups, Dariusz has spent over 15 years very closesly in IT industry and technical product delivery.

Understaing human behavior, social psychology and psychiatry was his hobby for many years, until 2019, when he decided to implement a simple gamification for the first time in his office.

Effects of a simple game-like mechanics on his coworkers was astonishing, and since then he tested various implementations of different gamification concepts both in business world and personal development.

After studying current gamification fameworks, Dariusz noticed that the current state of the knowledge is still too immature for efficient business consulting, and started creating the **Emotional Shift** framework.

**Emotional Shift** is a framework that focues not on the techniques used, or functionalities, but on transforming specific user states.
