Linkedin is the most popular business-oriented social media in the world. This constantly growing network keeps people engaged, and gives many people hope to make more connections and sales.

L﻿ike any other social media platform, linkedin shows that a tiny fraction of users can get 100x the results of the rest of the crowd - and they are the ones who actually make meaningful connections and valuable sales.

E﻿veryone else is scrapping to get by with up to 2k followers, thinking how to get better in the game.

L﻿et's use my Emotion Shift framework to analyze the situation and create an engaging strategy, shall we?

## L﻿inkedIn users: who they are 

L﻿inkedIn has a very specific user group. The answer is: everyone in a working age. This is a very large group, but at least we managed to introduce some age restrictions.

L﻿inkedin users may have different motives for using the platform: most of the users have the account to appear professional, but don't interact too much. Many people create content semi-regularly to increase their outreach, but are too shy, don't have enough skills to make it as protifable as they want it to be.

T﻿here is obviously also this narrow group of real influencers, with over 5k followers, often with tens of thousands of followers who have "made it" and probably use linkedin to gain significant business advantage.

### Why should you consider building your profile on LinkedIn?

S﻿ome would say that they hate linkedin, that this platform delivers nothing more than spam or half-spam and is just a waste of time. I say, it is more like a modern business card. Your linkedin profile gives you the good old my-space vibe where you can build your own identity and keep it for years.

I﻿magine you are being fired from you current job and have 15k followers in your network to ask about new opportunity. Wouldn't it be 100x better than just sending CV as another anonymous person to various companies?

T﻿he image you create is solely in your hands and you will keep it  for many years as linkedin connections do not expire. Plus it is free to use.

## L﻿ets pick a target audience for your linkedin profile

B﻿ecause we already noticed, that almost everyone uses linkedin, we need to try to pick a sample from this group that we could tailor our messages to.

L﻿ets go for CEO's, company owners, chairmans of the board.

W﻿hat kind of emotions do they feel? What do they see? What do they think when they (in average) interact with the platform? What do they seek? What are they worried about maybe? These questions we will try to answer in a second.

### D﻿efining leading emotional set for ceo's browsing linkedin

\-﻿ are they worried about their competition?

\-﻿ are they worried about the economy changes and its impact on their business? 

\-﻿ are they confident, in the mood to share their wisdom here and there? 

\-﻿ are they tired, need to rest, wind down? or maybe energised, looking for opportunity?

\-﻿ are they looking to see something good? starving for upligfing story/video? Or rather they are emotionally distant?

\-﻿ are they willing to chat 1v1 or think it is waste of time unless they pick you?

\-﻿ are they posting? how often? What group actually feels forced to post?

\-﻿ are they willing to learn? happy to acknowledge someones knowledge or willing to get entertained?

\-﻿ are they hooked? or "aware of fake clownshow"

\-﻿ are they looking to meet someone on linkedin? who?



N﻿egative: fear of the future (economy, competition)

N﻿eutral: emotional distance, do not want to connect with someone who they don't know, not delusional about the only one reason everyone is here

P﻿ositive: energized, actively learning, posting
