Many people try to understand "what is gamification"? The answer is quite simple, yet is explained in many different ways.

T﻿he simple definition I like the most is simply:

> ## **Gamification creates true engagement, brings joy, a sense of accomplishment and builds habits.**



**O﻿ther sources define it as follows:**

"**Gamification is the addition of game elements to non-game activities"

"﻿**Gamification** is the strategic attempt to enhance systems, services, organizations, and activities by creating similar experiences to those experienced when playing games in order to motivate and engage users."

According to Gartner, gamification is *“the use of game mechanics and experience design to digitally engage and motivate people to achieve their goals”.*



## W﻿hy gamification definition is based on engagement?

G﻿amification is about altering user mood to movitate him subconsciously into going through deisred path of actions. Engagement is the core element of it. No "set of game elements" would work without this result.

Have you ever played a boring game? Me too. Gamification is not only about 'game elements'. It really is about making things fun, engaging, through proper architecture of the system, that uses UI principles, movement, colors, social psychology, loss aversion, perceived value creation and many many more elements working together. **Good mood comes firs**

## How about e-commerce gamification and loyality programs?
