**Claim**

Small rewards are much better drivers of motivation than the big one.

**Study**

### Festinger & Carlsmith's Study (1954)

71 participants of the experiment were asked to do a very boring task.

Half of them got a normal description of this task, the second half had got it described as something very enjoyable.

After a very long hour of the test, some of the participants were asked to finish (N=20) = control group.

The rest was split into 2 groups:

The first group was offered just 1$ to take the position of the experimenter and try to describe the task like it is something joyful.\
\
The second group was offered 20$ for the same ask.\
