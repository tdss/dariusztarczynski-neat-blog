## Listen to yourself today

What actually makes you happy? What can you do right now to make yourself happy? What is just within reach?

See what thoughts, visions, and feelings come to your mind first.

It doesn't have to be something huge or important. Size doesn't matter here. What matters is the act of self-compassion. 

What matters is you fulfillng one wish that is yours and for yourself.



## So what could make you happy today?

Would that be time spent with nature? Is short walk within your reach?

Would that be a cup of tea with honey and a slice of orange?

Maybe, you would just want to sit on a couch and watch a movie?



You see, any answer fits. The big step here is a conscious decision that you are doing it for yourself.



## Get your mind and body aligned by listening

When you listen to yourself, also your needs and wants, you reintegrate that part of your brain that is always there but always silenced. 

Treat yourself, so taht you can be happy with yourself.



On this healthy ground, you can make the change.
