## What is the initial step to tackle procrastination?

**Identify your "why".** Why do you want to accomplish the task you're procrastinating on? It's important to connect with the purpose or value of the task to generate intrinsic motivation.

> *“Start with why.”* - **Simon Sinek**

When you connect with the 'why', it becomes easier to motivate yourself to get started. Remember, even if a task seems small or insignificant, it could be a stepping stone to something bigger.

## What do I do when I find myself avoiding a task?

**Break it down into smaller tasks.** A common reason for procrastination is that the task feels too big or overwhelming. In such situations, breaking it down into smaller, manageable tasks can be helpful.

Every big task is just a series of smaller tasks. Instead of thinking about the entire project, just focus on the next small step.

## How can I make the task seem less daunting?

**Turn it into a game.** Gamification can make tasks more enjoyable and less daunting. For instance, you could set a timer and see how much of the task you can complete in that time, or challenge a friend to see who can finish a similar task first.

> *“In every job that must be done, there is an element of fun. You find the fun and 'snap', the job's a game.”* - **Mary Poppins**

## What if I slip up and procrastinate again?

**Treat setbacks as learning opportunities, not failures.** If you find yourself procrastinating again, instead of berating yourself, try to figure out why you procrastinated and how you can avoid it in the future.

> *“Mistakes are the portals of discovery.”* - **James Joyce**

So, don't be afraid of mistakes. They are opportunities to learn and grow.

## How can I keep track of my progress in overcoming procrastination?

**Monitor your successes, no matter how small.** Keeping track of your success in overcoming procrastination can motivate you to keep going. Every time you successfully overcome procrastination, make a note of it.

> *“The secret of getting ahead is getting started.”* - **Mark Twain**

Celebrate these victories, no matter how small they might seem.

By using these strategies from behavioral science, you can change your approach to procrastination. Remember, the aim is not to completely eliminate procrastination, but to manage it effectively so it doesn't impede your progress. Keep going, one step at a time!
