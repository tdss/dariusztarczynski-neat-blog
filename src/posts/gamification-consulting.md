**Heard about gamification but not sure how exactly could it be implemented?**

If so, let me guide you through the process step by step.

**Step 1** - initial strategy call. Sometimes it takes 40 minutes, sometimes 2 hours. During this time we will analyze the following basic aspects of the project:

* your product idea
* what would be your desired outcome
* what is your timeframe for this project
* any other questions you might have
* a little bit of brainstorming, throwing ideas, to better understand your point of view

To start, simply book a paid consultation from here: <https://calendly.com/dariusz-tdsoft/60-minute-consultation>

Is it even to early for this step for you? Feel free to use a free 30-minute "lets get to know each other" meeting, to exchange some early thougths: <https://calendly.com/dariusz-tdsoft/meeting-with-dariusz>
